# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
 ruby '2.6.3'

* System dependencies

* Configuration
  bundle install

* Database creation
  bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
  bundle exec rspec

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* P.S.
  I would also add some rating to search criteria of destinations, for example in case we prefer destination to match product by category rather than price.
